On the CAD-compatible conversion of S-patches

WAIT 2019

* Introduction [3m]
** Motivation
- n-sided surfaces vs. CAD systems
- central split / trimmed => not watertight / continuity/parameterization issues
** Previous work
- S-patch paper => theoretical solution, few details, no examples
- blossoming [Ramshaw]
- Simplex composition x2
* Simplexes & S-patches [7m]
- simplex: n + 1 points in n dimensions => segment, triangle, tetrahedron etc.
- barycentric coordinates: (unique) coefficients in the affine combination of vertices of a simplex
- Bezier curve:
  C(u) = sum_i P_i B^d_i (u) = sum_i P_i d! / (i! (d-i)!) u^i (1-u)^(d-i)
  s := (i, d - i), lambda := (u, 1 - u)
  C(lambda) = sum_s P_s d! / (s1! s2!) lambda1^s1 lambda2^s2
- Bezier triangle:
  s has 3 nonnegative numbers, adding up to d
  lambda = barycentric coordinates of a 2D point relative to some simplex (the domain triangle)
  T(lambda) = sum_s P_s d! / (s1! s2! s3!) lambda1^s1 lambda2^s2 lambda3^s3
- S-patch:
  s has n nonnegative numebrs, adding up to d
  lambda = barycentric coordinates of an (n-1)D point relative to some simplex
  S(lambda) = sum_s P_s d! / prod_i(si!) prod_i(lambda_i^s_i)
- Bezier-simplex: a mapping from k-dimensional barycentric coordinates using Bernstein basis
- How to create the barycentric coordinates of an (n-1)D point?
  => generalized barycentric coordinates
  n-sided polygonal domain (now regular)
  Wachspress coordinates => prod_{j!=i} dist_j(p) / sum_k prod_{j!=k} dist_j(p)
- Easy to see that the boundaries are Bezier curves of degree d
- Strange control net, many control points => next (KEPAF) paper
* Conversion [7m]
- overview (quadrilateral -> tensor product)
** Conversion to quadrilateral S-patch
- Wachspress coordinates from barycentric coordinates => in Bezier simplex form (Wn)
- pseudoaffinity => 4-sided S-patch as the composition of Bezier simplexes
- W4^-1 => using canonical simplex
- S => using homogenized coordinates
- Wn => ? use blossoming
- blossoming intro
- Wn blossom equation
- simplex composition [simple equation, efficient algorithm] => details in the paper
** Conversion to tensor product
- Equation
* Example [1m]
* Discussion [2m]
- efficiency
- triangles
- control net quality
