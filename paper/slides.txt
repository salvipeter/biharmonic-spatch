G1 hole filling with S-patches made easy

KEPAF 2019

* Introduction [2m]
** Motivation
- S-patches - algebraically perfect generalization of Bezier surfaces
- Strange control network, many control points => usability
- Definition by a Bezier ribbon network
** Previous work
- S-patch paper solves it => few details, only for quadratic and cubic boundaries
- Transfinite surfaces solve the same problem (e.g. MC)
- GB patches also have "meaningful" interior control
* S-patches [5m]
- Definition
- Control net structure, adjacency (lines in the control net)
- Boundary panels
* Hole filling [11m]
- Stages
** Boundaries [6m]
- Boundaries are degree d Bezier curves => C0 trivial
- G1 between two S-patches:
  - boundary panels affine images of the domain polygon
  - opposite boundary panels in the same plane
- convert the ribbons into Bezier triangle form, with twist-compatibility at the corners
- this can be done with degree d + 3
- suffices to compute 3 points of the boundary panels (rest is from affine transformation)
  - 2 are trivial (from the degree elevation of the boundary curve)
  - the remaining one is not [see the paper]
** Interior [5m]
- Farin: C0 Coons patch with Bezier boundaries ~ simple mask on the control net of a Bezier patch
- harmonic mask ~ minimal patch
- simple linear equation system
- Monterde et al: harmonic & biharmonic masks
- Mask definition: based on adjacency
- Biharmonic mask: apply the harmonic mask to itself
  - natural positioning
* Examples [1m]
* Conclusion [1m]
